<h1 align="center">HNCut Plugin</h1>
The purpose of this plugin is to detect and quantify biomarkers in histopathology images by allowing the users to select just a few representative pixels (swatch) from the color region of interest.

## Installation:
##### 1.	Install Matlab Runtime R2015a (8.5) 64 bit version:
http://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2015a/deployment_files/R2015a/installers/win64/MCR_R2015a_win64_installer.exe
##### 2.	Copy HNCut.dll to C:\Programs Files (x86)\Sedeen Viewer\plugins\
##### 3.	Copy HNCut.exe to C:\Programs Files (x86)\Sedeen Viewer 

## Image Requirements:
##### 1.	The resolution should be 20x or 40x so the user can pick the swatch easily.

## Usage:
##### 1.	Open Sedeen, load an image and select “HNCut” from the algorithm menu.
##### 2.	Click “Run”
##### 3.	In the pop-up image, select a few representative pixels (<10) from the color region of interest and press “Enter” when finish selection.
##### 4.	The user will see the HNCut result.
